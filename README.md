Uber Technologies, Inc., commonly known as Uber, is an American technology company. Its services include ride-hailing, food delivery, package delivery, couriers, freight transportation, and, through a partnership with Lime, electric bicycle and motorized scooter rental.

We will mainly use data regarding Uber ride

we will use Python to analyze data from Uber.

# Executive Summary
Throughout the analysis, I was able to pull out several interesting insights:
- Purpose Of Trips for meeting, meal/Entertain
- Friday Has The Highest Number of Trip
- 20 to 25th day has number of trips per each day
- 12th month the trips in the month

We will use Python to:

- Check how long do people travel with Uber?
- What Hour Do Most People Take Uber To Their Destination?
- Check The Purpose Of Trips
- Which Day Has The Highest Number Of Trips
- What Are The Number Of Trips Per Each Day?
- What Are The Trips In The Month
- The starting points of trips. Where Do People Start Boarding Their Trip From Most?
